Wishing you all a very merry festive season and a happy, healthy new year!

My heartfelt thanks go out to clients, friends and family who have supported me in 2017. You rock!

This year's cards were Riso printed by the lovely people at [Marc the Printers](http://www.marctheprinters.co.uk).

I hope to bring you more from [Blank State](http://www.blankstate.co.uk) in 2018.
